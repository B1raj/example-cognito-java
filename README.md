# A Java Web-app Using AWS Cognito

Cognito is marketed as a client-side technology. It also happens to be by far the worst-documented Amazon service that I've ever used. However, its feature set is compelling: you can manage users, provide validation of both email and mobile phone, and support multi-factor authentication. But, as I said, it's the worst-documented Amazon service that I've ever used.

Based on the documentation, reading the Android source code, and a bunch of experimentation, I've worked out how to use it from the server side. I've wrapped the basic operations in Java servlets, with some simple front-end pages to invoke them. Currently it supports the following features:

* Users identified via email address.
* Signup uses a temporary password, generated by Cognito.
* Authentication using Cognito-generated tokens (with caching so we don't hit a call limit).

There will be a blog post that describes this code in more detail.

If you believe that I'm using the tool wrongly, feel free to open an issue.
